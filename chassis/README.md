# Introduction

This folder contains a designs and manufacturing files for the Rolio 46 keyboard chassis.

The folders within here are described below.

## Electronics

This contains STEP file models with the electronics and PCB. These can be used when creating new chassis or modifying the existing models.

## CNC

This is by far the most expensive of the three options. It is also the most aesthetically pleasing, rigid and durable choice.

It does have the drawback of being the heaviest.

More information and preview images can be found in the [CNC Section](cnc/README.md).


## SLS

This is much cheaper than CNC and will still produce a very durable and professional looking chassis.

SLS printing has been tested with JLCPCB and yielded good results. It should be noted that the SLS design should also be compatible with MJF and SLA manufacturing techniques, though this has not yet been validated.

More information and sample images can be found in the [SLS Section](sls/README.md).

## FDM

Contains design files for a FDM 3D printed chassis.

This is the most accessible manufacturing option and the cheapest.

The largest drawback of this manufacturing technique is that layer lines may be visible. Additionally the chassis may not be as rigid as desired depending on the filament used.

More information and example images can be found in the [FDM Section](fdm/README.md).
