# Introduction

This folder contains a designs and manufacturing files for the Rolio keyboard chassis.

The folders within here are described below.

## Electronics

This contains STEP file models with the electronics and PCB. These can be used when creating new chassis or modifying the existing models.

## FDM

Contains design files for a FDM 3D printed chassis.

This is the most accessible manufacturing option and the cheapest.

The largest drawback of this manufacturing technique is that layer lines may be visible. Additionally the chassis may not be as rigid as desired depending on the filament used.

More information and preview images can be found in the [FDM Section](fdm/README.md).


## CNC

This is by far the most expensive of the two options. It is also the most aesthetically pleasing, rigid and durable choice.

It does have the drawback of being the heaviest.
