# Introduction

This section contains all of the files and information that is needed to manufacture a CNC Rolio46.1/46.2 chassis.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made available so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

# Example

Purple backlight LED's with dark anodized aluminium & tenting stand.

# Main Chassis

The STEP files in "CNC Parts" must be uploaded to provide the design itself.

When preparing the order use the following settings:
 * Material 6061 Aluminum
 * Finish
   * Bead Blasting - 120 mesh
   * Glossy Anodizing - Natural
 * Tolerance ISO 2768 medium
 * Threads "Yes"
   * Upload the "Thread and Machine Spec.pdf" to provide thread details

You will need to request a manual quote from JLCPCB before you can proceed to place your order.

In addition to the CNC parts some components need to be printed using FDM. The required printing files can be found in the "3D Printing" folder, you will TPU & PLA filaments.

To complete assembly you will need the following additional hardware:

| Quantity  | Description  | Ref  | Value  |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| 8  | 9mm Silicone Feet | -  | - |
| 10 | M2x4mm Screws | -  | -  |

# Travel Case

A travel Case is also available for the Rolio46.1/46.2. All of the files required to print your own are available in the "Production Files" folder.

To complete the travel case you will need some additional small hardware items:

| Quantity  | Description  | Ref  | Value  |
|:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| 4 | M2x30mm Screws | -  | - |
