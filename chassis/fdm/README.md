# Introduction

This is a chassis that can be printed using a conventional FDM (filament) printer without needing supports for the critical components.

It has been tested using a Bambu Labs X1C with a 0.4mm nozzle.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made available so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

# Examples

Backlight on, printed in Voxelab Galaxy PLA.

From above with the backlight off, the Voxelab PLA has a very cool color changing effect depending on the angle you look from & lighting conditions, though these photographs appear to exaggerate the effect somewhat (iPhones!).

# The Chassis

It is strongly recommend that you use a rigid filament, PLA+ and PETG are both flexible and not recommended unless they also have a stiffening additive such as carbon fiber. If using a carbon fiber filament please ensure that it is non conductive.

The "Top Plate" &  "Controller Cover" should be printed face down with supports disabled.

The bottom plate can be printed in its natural orientation.

The "Reset Button" and "USB Diffuser" should be printed on a smooth build plate with very fine layer lines (tested at 0.12mm).

The "Power Switch" should be printed with a raft and very fine layer lines too. When printing a multicolor switch I found that a 0.2mm nozzle yielded best results, however, a 0.4mm nozzle does also work.

The "USB Diffuser" is optional, if it is printed it should ideally be printed in clear filament so that light from the LED indicators can shine through.
