# Introduction

This is a chassis that can be printed using a conventional FDM (filament) printer.

It has been tested using a Bambu Labs X1C with a 0.4mm nozzle.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made available so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

# Examples

Backlight on and at a lowish setting.

The USB port has a small printable surround that makes the charge and Bluetooth indicator LEDs visible.

# The Chassis

It is strongly recommend that you use a rigid filament, PLA+ and PETG are both flexible and not recommended unless they also have a stiffening additive such as carbon fiber. If using a carbon fiber filament please ensure that it is non conductive.

The "Top Plate" should be printed face down with supports enabled, bridge support should be disabled.

The "LCD Bracket", "Reset Button" and "USB Diffuser" should be printed on a smooth build plate with very fine layer lines (tested at 0.12mm).

The "USB Diffuser" is optional, if it is printed it should ideally be printed in clear filament so that light from the LED indicators can shine through.

# Other Parts

You will also require 10x M2x4 screws & 8x 9mm non-slip silicone feet.
