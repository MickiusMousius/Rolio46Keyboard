# Introduction

This is a chassis that can be printed using a conventional FDM (filament) printer without needing supports for the critical components.

It has been tested using a Bambu Labs X1C with a 0.4mm nozzle.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made available so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

# Example

Printed in Voxelab Galaxy PLA.

# The Chassis

The prnting file was prepared using Bambu Studio and should be compatible with OrcaSlicer too.

If you wish to prepare your own print files th original CAD models are included in this repo.

The "Top Plate" &  "Controller Cover" should be printed face down with supports disabled.

The bottom plate can be printed in its natural orientation.

The "USB Diffuser" is optional, if it is printed it should ideally be printed in clear filament so that light from the LED indicators can shine through.
