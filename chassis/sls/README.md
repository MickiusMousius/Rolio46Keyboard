# Introduction

This section contains all of the files and information that is needed to manufacture an SLS Rolio 46.1 chassis. SLS is able to produce very durable dark colored matte parts as shown in the "Examples" section.

It should be noted here that the SLS parts should also be able to be fabricated using SLA or MJF manufacturing techniques too, however, these have not been tested.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made available so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

# Main Chassis

Only the "Top Plate" is tested for printing via SLS, however, the bottom plate should also print fine using SLS/MJF/SLA.

# Other Parts

In addition to the SLS parts some components need to be printed using FDM (SLA may also work). The required STL files can be found in the "FDM Parts" folder.

## FDM PLA Parts

When printing the FDM parts the "Reset Button" and "USB Diffuser" should be printed on a smooth build plate with very fine layer lines (tested at 0.12mm).

The "Power Switch" should be printed with a raft and very fine layer lines too. When printing a multicolor switch I found that a 0.2mm nozzle yielded best results, however, a 0.4mm nozzle does also work.

The "USB Diffuser" is optional, if it is printed it should ideally be printed in clear filament so that light from the LED indicators can shine through.
