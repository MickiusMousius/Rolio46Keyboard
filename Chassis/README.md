# Introduction

This folder contains a designs and manufacturing files for the Rolio keyboard chassis.

Each design is of a different finishing standard and pricepoint.

The folders within here are described below.

## Electronics

This contains STEP file models with the electronics and PCB. These can be used when creating new Chassis or modifying the existing models. These files should be helpful for validating component clearances.

## FDM

Contains design files for a FDM 3D printed chassis.

This is the most accessible manufacturing option and likely the cheapest.

The largest drrawback of this manufacturing technique is that layer lines may be visible. Additionally the chassis may not be as rigid as desired depednding on the filament used.

The other chassis designs are based on this one as it is the cheapest for prtototyping.

## MJF

Contains designs for MJF, SLS or SLA chassis.

All three manufacturing methods should produce better cosmetic results than FDM.

MJF is more expensive than SLA but should also produce a more durable result.

## CNC

This is by far the most expensive of the three major options (annecdotally 6 times the cost of MJF or 12 times that of SLA).

it will produce the most aesthetically pleasing, rigid and durable result whe using aluminium.

It does have the drawback of being the heaviest.
