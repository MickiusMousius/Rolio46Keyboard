This is a chassis that can be printed using a conventional FDM (filament) printer.

It has been testing using a Bambu labs X1C with a 0.4mm nozzle.

The STEP files are the original CAD files, these are made avilable so that modifications can easily be made. If the STEP files from the Electronics folder are imported too it will be possible to see the clearances for various parts.

The "Top Plate" should be printed face down (Bambu studio's auto orient does this automatically) with supports enabled, bridge support should be disabled.

The "LCD Bracket" and "USB Diffuser" should be printer on a smooth build plate with very fine layer lines (tested at 0.12mm).

The "USB Diffuser" is optional, if it is printed it should ideally be printed in clear filament so that light from the LED indicators can shine through.
